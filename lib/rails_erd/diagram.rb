require "rails_erd/domain"

module RailsERD
  # This class is an abstract class that will process a domain model and
  # allows easy creation of diagrams. To implement a new diagram type, derive
  # from this class and override +process_entity+, +process_relationship+,
  # and (optionally) +save+.
  #
  # As an example, a diagram class that generates code that can be used with
  # yUML (http://yuml.me) can be as simple as:
  #
  #   require "rails_erd/diagram"
  #
  #   class YumlDiagram < RailsERD::Diagram
  #     setup { @edges = [] }
  #
  #     each_relationship do |relationship|
  #       return if relationship.indirect?
  #
  #       arrow = case
  #       when relationship.one_to_one?   then "1-1>"
  #       when relationship.one_to_many?  then "1-*>"
  #       when relationship.many_to_many? then "*-*>"
  #       end
  #
  #       @edges << "[#{relationship.source}] #{arrow} [#{relationship.destination}]"
  #     end
  #
  #     save { @edges * "\n" }
  #   end
  #
  # Then, to generate the diagram (example based on the domain model of Gemcutter):
  #
  #   YumlDiagram.create
  #   #=> "[Rubygem] 1-*> [Ownership]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Subscription]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Version]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-1> [Linkset]
  #   #    [Rubygem] 1-*> [Dependency]
  #   #    [Version] 1-*> [Dependency]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [Ownership]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [Subscription]
  #   #    [User] 1-*> [WebHook]"
  #
  # For another example implementation, see Diagram::Graphviz, which is the
  # default (and currently only) diagram type that is used by Rails ERD.
  #
  # === Options
  #
  # The following options are available and will by automatically used by any
  # diagram generator inheriting from this class.
  #
  # attributes:: Selects which attributes to display. Can be any combination of
  #              +:content+, +:primary_keys+, +:foreign_keys+, +:timestamps+, or
  #              +:inheritance+.
  # disconnected:: Set to +false+ to exclude entities that are not connected to other
  #                entities. Defaults to +false+.
  # indirect:: Set to +false+ to exclude relationships that are indirect.
  #            Indirect relationships are defined in Active Record with
  #            <tt>has_many :through</tt> associations.
  # inheritance:: Set to +true+ to include specializations, which correspond to
  #               Rails single table inheritance.
  # polymorphism:: Set to +true+ to include generalizations, which correspond to
  #                Rails polymorphic associations.
  # warn:: When set to +false+, no warnings are printed to the
  #        command line while processing the domain model. Defaults
  #        to +true+.
