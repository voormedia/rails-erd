1.1.0
-----

* Abstract models (with 'self.abstract_class = true') are now considered for
  the domain and will be displayed if 'polymorphism=true'. This should also
  fix errors that could occur if abstract models had any associations.
* Correctly save Graphviz diagrams with spaces in the filename (contributed by
  Neil Chambers).
* Add only/exclude to CLI (contributed by Dru Ibarra).


1.0.0
-----

* The internal API is now stable and will be backwards compatible until
  the next major version.
* Added experimental command line interface (erd). The CLI still requires a
  Rails application to be present, but it may one day support other kinds of
  applications.
* Crow's foot notation (also known as the Information Engineering notation)
  can be used by adding 'notation=crowsfoot' to the 'rake erd' command
  (contributed by Jeremy Holland).
* Filter models by using the only or exclude options (only=ModelOne,ModelTwo
  or exclude=ModelThree,ModelFour) from the command line (contributed by
  Milovan Zogovic).

  Gustavson).
* Ignore custom limit/scale attributes that cannot be converted to an integer
  (reported by Adam St. John).

  loaded successfully by the 'rake erd' task (reported by Greg Weber).

0.4.4
-----

  causes .dot files to be compatible with OmniGraffle, which otherwise fails
  to import graphs with HTML node labels (issue reported by Lucas Florio,
  implementation based on template by Troy Anderson).
* Prevent models named after Graphviz reserved words (Node, Edge) from causing
  errors in .dot files (reported by gguthrie).
* Improved error messages when Graphviz is throwing errors (reported by
  Michael Irwin).

  precision 5 and scale 2 is now indicated with (5,2).
* Fixed deprecation warnings for edge Rails (upcoming 3.1).

0.4.1
-----

* Fix processing of associations with class_name set to absolute module paths.
* Adjust model loading process to include models in non-standard paths eagerly.

  (inheritance=true).
* Support to optionally display polymorphic associations (polymorphism=true).
* Adjustments to 'advanced' style so that it matches original Bachman style,
  and therefore now called 'bachman'.
* Ignore models without tables (reported by Mark Chapman).
* Mutual indirect relationships are now combined.
* Changed API for diagram generation.
* Restructured classes and renamed several API properties and methods.
* Added new edge type to describe single table inheritance and polymorphic
  associations: Specialization.
* Added compatibility for Active Record 3.1 (beta), removed dependency on Arel.
* Rubinius compatibility.

-----

* Added the ability to support multiple styles of cardinality notations.
  Currently supported types are 'simple' and 'advanced'.
* Added option to exclude indirect relationships (indirect=false).
* Added option to change or disable the diagram title (title='Custom title').
* Altered the type descriptions of attributes.
* Renamed options for flexibility and clarity.
* Improved internal logic to determine the cardinality of relationships.
* More versatile API that allows you to inspect relationships and their
  cardinalities.
* Changed line widths to 1.0 to avoid invisible node boundaries with older
  versions of Graphviz (reported by Mike McQuinn).
* Bundled examples based on actual applications.

0.2.0
-----

* Added simple way to create your own type of diagrams with a tiny amount of code.
* Improved internal API and documentation.
* Subtle changes in diagram style.
* Fixed error where non-mutual relationships might be inadvertently classified
  as indirect relationships.
* Fixed error where diagrams with a vertical layout might fail to be generated.

0.1.1
-----
