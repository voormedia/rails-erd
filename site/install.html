<p>
  Rails ERD generates diagrams using <a href="http://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
  a visualisation library. Continue to read how to install Graphviz and Rails ERD,
  so you can start creating model diagrams.
</p>


<h2><a name="install-graphviz">Install Graphviz</a></h2>
<p>
  Rails ERD requires Graphviz. To install it, try one of the following...
</p>

{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
 brew install graphviz           # Homebrew on Mac OS X
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
% sudo port install graphviz      # Macports on Mac OS X
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
% sudo aptitude install graphviz  # Debian and Ubuntu
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <strong>Graphviz 2.22+ is recommended</strong>. Earlier versions may work,
  but many bugs have been fixed since. If you have trouble with earlier versions,
  you may wish to disable indirect relationships.

<h2><a name="install-rails-erd">Install Rails ERD</a></h2>
<p>
  Rails ERD runs on all Rails 3 platforms: Ruby 1.8/1.9, Rubinius, or JRuby
  all work fine. Add Rails ERD as a plugin to your Ruby on Rails 3
  application. In your <tt>Gemfile</tt>...
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
group :development do
  gem "rails-erd"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> will install everything you need...
</p>
{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
% bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="generate">Generate your first diagram</a></h2>
<p>
  You now have a new Rake task in your application. Generate an up-to-date model diagram with...
</p>
{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
% rake erd
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <strong>Done!</strong> Open <tt>ERD.pdf</tt> to view your diagram.
  Not completely satisfied? You can <a href="/customise.html">customise the output</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="without-rails">Not using Rails?</a></h2>
<p>
  If you use Active Record 3 outside of a Rails application, you can also use Rails
  ERD to create model diagrams for you. Install the <tt>rails-erd</tt> gem, load your
  models, and execute...
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Make sure all your models are loaded.
require "rails_erd/diagram/graphviz"

RailsERD::Diagram::Graphviz.create
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="trouble">Having trouble?</a></h2>
<p>
  If Rails ERD doesn't work like you expected it to, don't give up immediately.
  First of all, check if you can generate a graph without rendering it...
</p>
{% highlight console cssclass=console %}
% rake erd filetype=dot
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Check for a file named <tt>ERD.dot</tt>, and see if it's not empty. If everything
  worked so far, Rails ERD is probably working fine. You can either tweak the
  output before processing it with <tt>dot</tt> (the command line tool that
  ships with Graphviz), or you can try with a very recent version of
  <a href="http://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>, <strong>preferrably 2.26+</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  If things are still not running smoothly, I'd love to hear from you.
  You can either create a <a href="http://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd/issues">new issue</a>,
  or drop me a line at <b>r.timmermans <em>at</em> voormedia.com</b>. If
  something goes wrong while generating a diagram, please provide a set of
  example models that exhibit the problem.
</p>
